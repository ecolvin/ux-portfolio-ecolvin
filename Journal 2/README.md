### Journal Entry #2: Application Orientation 
Eric Colvin - 4/25/21

  The topic for my second journal entry is the usability engineering behind the NBC Sports My Teams App. There are a few different issues that I've ran into with this app that have bugged me, but the most prominent issue and the one that I’m going to talk about today is the orientation. I'm usually opening the app to watch a San Jose Sharks game on my iPad, but the app always defaults to a vertical orientation regardless of what device you're on. Then, its orientation will only update when the orientation of the device is changed. This means that when I open the app on my iPad, every time, I have to open the app, turn my iPad vertical, and then turn my iPad back to horizontal to be able to view the app horizontally. Plus, while the issue mainly appears on a table, it’s still an issue on a phone since you probably would want to watch the game horizontally anyways, so you’ll still have to do the same thing. This UI breaks the **industry standard** of having an app automatically open up in the correct orientation, and as a result leads to a small but very **unsatisfying** issue in its UI.
