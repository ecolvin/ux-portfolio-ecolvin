### Journal Entry #1: Light Switch Mapping 
Eric Colvin - 3/7/21

  The topic for my first journal entry is the usability engineering behind light switches. This topic was brought to my attention while I was helping a friend move into his new place. When we got there it was dark, so I went to turn on the light. To start with, the light switch panel was a little hard to find. Generally a light switch is put on the nearest wall right as you enter a door since turning on the light is often the first thing you do when you enter a room. This switch was still on that nearest wall, but was around a corner since there wasn't much wall space between the door and the corner (see diagram). I was still able to find the light switch somewhat easily, however, so it could've been worse. The main issue that I noticed when trying to turn on the lights was with the **mapping**. There were two light switches on the panel, one for the inside light and one for the porch light. Based on the location of the switch and its relation to the door/outside, one would assume that the left switch would turn on the inside light while the right switch would turn on the outside light. The switches, however, were swapped and the left switched turned on the outside light, while the right switch turned on the inside light. This was somewhat counter-intuitive and led to me having to flip both switches to find which one I wanted. Obviously, this isn't a huge problem, but it is something that could be easily fixed by simply having the switches be correctly **mapped** to the closest light.
