### [Journal Entry #3: Netflix Autoplay](Journal3/README.md)
Eric Colvin - 5/18/21

My third journal is about the autoplay feature on netflix. For whatever reason, Netflix decided to add a "feature" where any time you hover over a show, it will start playing either a preview or sometimes a full episode of that show. This causes a number of problems. For one, if you hover over the wrong show, you could potentially see things that you didn't want to see (nudity/gore/etc... that happens to be right at the start of an episode). Going along with this, many shows start each episode with a recap, so if you share your netflix account and someone is ahead of you on a show, the recap from a future episode could start playing and spoil a bunch of the show for you. Another issue with this is that if you're just browsing and trying to find a show to watch, you keep getting bombarded with noise every time you try to read the description of something. Sometimes this isn't much of a problem, but other times it's downright obnoxious. Additionally, this can be confusing to a user who is just trying look at a description but then hears an episode start playing and closes the description tab thinking they had just started watching the show instead. Overall this feature offers very little benefit and a ton of issues that ultimately leads to a very **unsatisfying** user experience.
