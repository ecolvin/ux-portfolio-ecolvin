### Journal Entry #1: Light Switch Mapping 
Eric Colvin - 3/7/21

  The topic for my first journal entry is the usability engineering behind light switches. This topic was brought to my attention while I was helping a friend move into his new place. When we got there it was dark, so I went to turn on the light. To start with, the light switch panel was a little hard to find. Generally a light switch is put on the nearest wall right as you enter a door since turning on the light is often the first thing you do when you enter a room. This switch was still on that nearest wall, but was around a corner since there wasn't much wall space between the door and the corner (see diagram). I was still able to find the light switch somewhat easily, however, so it could've been worse. The main issue that I noticed when trying to turn on the lights was with the **mapping**. There were two light switches on the panel, one for the inside light and one for the porch light. Based on the location of the switch and its relation to the door/outside, one would assume that the left switch would turn on the inside light while the right switch would turn on the outside light. The switches, however, were swapped and the left switched turned on the outside light, while the right switch turned on the inside light. This was somewhat counter-intuitive and led to me having to flip both switches to find which one I wanted. Obviously, this isn't a huge problem, but it is something that could be easily fixed by simply having the switches be correctly **mapped** to the closest light.

### Journal Entry #2: Application Orientation 
Eric Colvin - 4/25/21

  The topic for my second journal entry is the usability engineering behind the NBC Sports My Teams App. There are a few different issues that I've ran into with this app that have bugged me, but the most prominent issue and the one that I’m going to talk about today is the orientation. I'm usually opening the app to watch a San Jose Sharks game on my iPad, but the app always defaults to a vertical orientation regardless of what device you're on. Then, its orientation will only update when the orientation of the device is changed. This means that when I open the app on my iPad, every time, I have to open the app, turn my iPad vertical, and then turn my iPad back to horizontal to be able to view the app horizontally. Plus, while the issue mainly appears on a table, it’s still an issue on a phone since you probably would want to watch the game horizontally anyways, so you’ll still have to do the same thing. This UI breaks the **industry standard** of having an app automatically open up in the correct orientation, and as a result leads to a small but very **unsatisfying** issue in its UI.

My view when opening the My Teams app on my iPad:
